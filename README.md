# Lights Out
*In this program I coded the hit 80's game Lights Out. When you click a tile, all 
available adjactent tiles to the top, bottom, left, and right will flip whatever 
state they are in (on to off, or off to on). The object of the game is to get all
tiles in the off position.

# Languages Used
*The language in which was used to make the engine of the game was C++. The Same language was also used in order to display the graphics of the program.

# Credit
*All base files that make the graphics code able to execute was done by Lisa Dion at the University of Vermont. Code in the rect.h/.cpp as well as engine.h/.cpp was changed by myself in order to make the functionality of the game work.
